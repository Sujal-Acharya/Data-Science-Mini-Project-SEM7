# Data-Science-Mini-Project
This project classifies crop yield into High, Medium, and Low categories using machine learning models. Features like area, season, crop type, and production are analyzed. Models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression are trained to predict yield levels and compare performance.
